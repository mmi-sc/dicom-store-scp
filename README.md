# 📦 DICOM Store SCP for AWS Marketplace (ECS)

This containerized application provides a robust DICOM C-STORE SCP service, enabling healthcare organizations to store medical imaging data reliably. DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is an established standard widely used to manage and transfer medical imaging data.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This containerized DICOM server receives and stores DICOM files either in an Amazon S3 bucket or within the container file system at `/app/storage`.
It supports running via the `docker run` command and deployment as part of an AWS Fargate ECS service.

---

## 🚀 Run the Container

1. Ensure you have pulled the container image from Amazon ECR following the **Pull container image** instructions.  
   As part of those steps, the `CONTAINER_IMAGES` environment variable should be set with the appropriate image URL.

2. **Run the container using the command below:**

```bash
docker run -p 11112:11112 $CONTAINER_IMAGES
```

The service is now operational.

By default, DICOM files are stored in `/app/storage`.  
*To store files in Amazon S3, deploy the container using ECS (Fargate). Local deployment with S3 is not supported.*

---

## ☁️ Deploy on AWS ECS (Fargate)

>The examples in this guide use specific names for clarity, but you may use any names you prefer.
Please note that S3 is a global service, so bucket names must be globally unique. Be sure to choose a name that is not already in use.

### Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 Bucket

1. Open the [Amazon S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Select your desired AWS region from the top-right region menu first.
3. Click **"Create bucket"**.
4. Name the bucket `my-dicom-storage-bucket`.
5. Click **"Create bucket"**.

### Step 2: Create an IAM Role for ECS Tasks

This IAM role enables ECS tasks to write to your bucket.

1. Open the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. Select **Roles**, then click **Create role**.
3. In the **Trusted entity type** section, select **AWS service**.
4. In the **Use case** section:
   - From the **Service or use case** dropdown menu, select **Elastic Container Service**.
   - Choose **Elastic Container Service Task** as the use case.
5. Click **Next**.
6. Click **Next** without selecting additional policies.
7. Enter `DicomScpTaskRole` as the role name, then click **Create role**.

Add an inline policy:

1. Select your new role, click **Add permissions** > **Create inline policy**.
2. Select the **JSON** tab, remove any existing content, and replace it with the policy below:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-dicom-storage-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-dicom-storage-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
3. Click **Next**, name it `DicomScpTaskPolicy`, and click **Create policy**.

### Step 3: ECS Task Definition

1. Open [ECS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/) > **Task Definitions**.
2. Click **Create new task definition** > **Create new task definition**.
3. In the **Task definition configuration** section, enter `dicom-scp-task` as the task family.
4. In the **Infrastructure requirements** section, select `DicomScpTaskRole` as **Task role**.
5. In the **Container** section, configure the container:
   - **Name**: `dicom-store-scp`
   - **Image URI**: Container image URL from ECR.
   - **Port mapping**: TCP `11112`  
                       Remove any default Container port
   - Environment variables:
     - `DICOM_BUCKET`: `my-dicom-storage-bucket`
6. Click **Create**.

### Step 4: Launch ECS Service

1. Navigate to the **Clusters** page in the [ECS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/) and click **Create cluster**.
2. Enter `dicom-scp-cluster` as the name of the cluster and click **Create**.
3. After the cluster has been created, open it.
4. On the **Services** tab, click **Create**.
5. In the **Service details** section:
   - **Task Definition family**: Select `dicom-scp-task`
     >Note: If a task definition with the same name was previously deleted, the revision number may not start at `1`.  
     You can enter the latest revision number explicitly, or leave the field blank to use the most recent revision automatically.
   - **Service name**: `dicom-scp-service`
6. In the **Networking** section:
   - **VPC**: Choose the default VPC, any VPC that includes public subnets, or create a new one.
   - **Subnets**: Choose at least one public subnet.
   - **Security groups**: Create or choose a security group allowing inbound TCP port `11112` from `0.0.0.0/0`.
   - **Public IP**: Confirm that it is set to **Turned on**.
7. Click **Create**.

After a few minutes, your task should display a **RUNNING** status.  
You can verify the container is listening on port `11112` and ready to accept DICOM C-STORE requests.

## 📁 DICOM File Storage Structure

DICOM files are stored in the following hierarchical format:
- If `DICOM_BUCKET` is set, files are saved under that S3 bucket.
- If `DICOM_BUCKET` is not set, files are saved locally under `/app/storage` within the container.

The storage path format is:

```
YYYY/MM/DD/Timestamp/StudyInstanceUID/SeriesInstanceUID/SOPInstanceUID.dcm
```

- `StudyDate` is used if available; otherwise, the current date is used.
- `Timestamp` represents the current UNIX time.

**Example:**

```
2025/05/23/1747994435/1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.73149934529919832686416396616359448504/1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.46359947900531364351870995163206461797/1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.7397960457184174305501312076486949118.dcm
```


## 📡 Verifying SCP Connectivity (Example Store SCU Operation)

After successful deployment:

1. Confirm ECS task status is `RUNNING`.
2. Send a DICOM file with an SCU client such as `storescu` from [DCMTK](https://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en):

```bash
storescu ecs-public-ip 11112 example.dcm
```

3. Confirm file storage in your S3 bucket (`my-dicom-storage-bucket`) via AWS S3 Console.
