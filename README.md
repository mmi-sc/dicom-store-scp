# DICOM Store SCP (PACS Server)

This container image provides a DICOM Store SCP service suitable for medical imaging workflows, compliant with DICOM C-STORE operations.

## üß© Overview

This is a containerized DICOM server that receives and stores DICOM files to an S3-compatible destination.
It supports deployment in local environments (`docker run`) or as part of an AWS Fargate ECS service.

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### 1. Run Locally with Docker

```bash
docker run -p 11112:11112 \
  -e DICOM_BUCKET=<your-dicom-bucket-name> \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id> \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key> \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<your-region> \
  public.ecr.aws/mmi/dicom-store-scp:latest
```

### 2. Use in ECS/Fargate Task Definition

```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "dicom-scp",
      "image": "public.ecr.aws/mmi/dicom-store-scp:latest",
      "portMappings": [
        { "containerPort": 11112 }
      ],
      "environment": [
        { "name": "DICOM_BUCKET", "value": "your-dicom-bucket-name" },
        { "name": "AE_TITLE", "value": "YOUR-AE-TITLE" },
        { "name": "LOG_LEVEL", "value": "DEBUG" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üì¶ Health Check

This container supports a health check that validates whether the SCP port is open:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK CMD nc -z localhost $SCP_PORT || exit 1
```

This helps ECS or Docker orchestrators detect when the service becomes unhealthy.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- Runs as non-root user (`dicomuser`)
- Uses `python:3.12-slim` for minimal attack surface
- Health check for stability

## üìÑ License

MIT or custom EULA as applicable.

## üîê AWS Credentials

This container does not include AWS credentials.

To enable S3 access, you must configure valid credentials via one of the following methods:

1. **AWS ECS Task Role (Recommended)**
   - Attach an IAM role with `s3:PutObject` and `s3:ListBucket` permissions to your ECS task.

2. **Environment variables (for local testing only)**
   - If running locally with `docker run`, pass credentials explicitly:

   ```bash
   -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id> \
   -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-access-key> \
   -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<your-region>
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: AWS CLI configuration via `aws configure` or `~/.aws/credentials` is not visible inside the container unless you explicitly mount that directory, which is not recommended for security reasons.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: Never hard-code credentials or use environment variables in production.

## üåç AWS Region Behavior

This container checks for `AWS_REGION` as an environment variable. If not provided, the AWS SDK (boto3) will fall back to:

- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable
- Region setting in `~/.aws/config`
- EC2 or ECS instance metadata (if available)

This ensures compatibility for both container-only and CDK-integrated deployments.
